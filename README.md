# DIODE_outdoor_with_MiDaS
This project evaluates the performance of the MiDaS model for monocular depth estimation on the DIODE Outdoor dataset. It includes:

• Loading and preprocessing DIODE Outdoor data

• Running MiDaS on selected test images

• Computing evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, AbsRel, and δ accuracy

• Visualizing prediction errors and depth maps

• Analyzing model failure cases (e.g., sky, glare, shadows)

The notebook is designed for Google Colab and uses PyTorch with timm and OpenCV libraries.
